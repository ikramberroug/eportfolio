      <p>I came into this world in 2003 in Rome, the capital of Italy. I spent my early years there, going to primary school until I turned nine in 2012.</p>

      <p>In 2012, my parents made the decision to go back to Morocco, my home country, and more specifically to Beni Mellal, a small city in the heart of Morocco. I continued my education there until I completed my baccalaureate, and I even pursued my first year of preparatory classes in that city.</p>
      <p>During the second year, I moved on to study my second year of preparatory classes at a more prestigious institution, Al Zahrawi, situated in Rabat.</p>

      <p>And now, I find myself residing in France, where I am currently pursuing my studies at ENSEEIHT, an engineering school located in Toulouse.</p>

      <p>In the upcoming years, I'm uncertain about my future residence or destinations. I am particularly intrigued by the dual-degree programs our school provides, such as the opportunity to pursue a master's degree at universities like Georgia Tech and EPFL.</p>
