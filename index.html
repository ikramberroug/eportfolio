                    <p>I came into this world in 2003 in Rome, the capital of Italy. I spent my early years there, going to primary school until I turned nine in 2012.</p>

                    <p>In 2012, my parents made the decision to go back to Morocco, my home country, and more specifically to Beni Mellal, a small city in the heart of Morocco. I continued my education there until I completed my baccalaureate, and I even pursued my first year of preparatory classes in that city.</p>
                    <p>During the second year, I moved on to study my second year of preparatory classes at a more prestigious institution, Al Zahrawi, situated in Rabat.</p>

        <p class="section__text__p2">I am excited to explore and engage with the domains of sustainability and civic engagement, even though I currently have limited experience in these areas. I believe that these aspects are essential for building a better world and making a positive impact on our communities. While I may not have prior experience, my commitment and enthusiasm to contribute are strong motivators for me to get involved and learn.</p>

            <p>Certainly, in the near future, I will be more active on this subject. As an example, since I am currently studying in Toulouse, I am ready to join the Toulouse-based association "Hall of Change" and engage in volunteer activities.</p>

            <p>During the Ecological and Social Transition Day organized at my school, ENSEEIHT, we had the opportunity to watch the film "Low Tech", a documentary produced by Adrien Bellay. This screening was a revelation for me. Through this documentary, I was able to grasp the true essence of "low tech" technologies and become aware of the significant impact that advanced technologies, or "high tech", have on our environment. This newfound insight has profoundly enriched my understanding of current ecological issues.</p>

            <p>During the same day, I also had the chance to attend a roundtable discussion on the topic of impact entrepreneurship. The guests were the CEOs of the startups Hector the Collector and BeeGuard! It was incredibly enlightening and motivating. This experience showed me the potential of aligning business ventures with environmental and social values, truly an inspiring moment that has expanded my perspective on how businesses can operate for the greater good.</p>
